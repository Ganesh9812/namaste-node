difference between RDMS and nosql
in RDBMS data is store in tables
in nosql database the data is store in document
we dont have table in mongodb and we call it as collection 
in tables we have rows, here we have document in mongodb
document will have fields
no need of joins or no need for data normalization in mongodb
collection --> documnets ---> each document --> fields
RDMS uses stuctured Query language
in No sql mongodb we have MQL query language
