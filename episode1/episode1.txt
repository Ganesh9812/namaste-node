what is nodejs
run js everywhere using node js
nodejs is js runtime built on chrome v8 js engine
nodejs is cross platform it can run on windows, linux, mac and lot of OS
nodejs is open source
maintained by Open js foundation community which maintains nodejs
nodejs helps to execute js outside the web browser-
js dominated in web world
when nodejs came you can run js everywhere
nodejs has event driver architecture and capabile of asynchronous I/O and asynchrous I/O also known as non blocking I/O
first versio of nodejs release in 2009 by ryan dahl
whatever the code we write in nodejs it is js, to run js we need a js engine
chrome has v8 js egine and firefox has spiker monkey engine
when ryan developed nodejs he initially used spider monkey and later shifted to v8 js engine to develop node js
ryan worked with joyent to develop nodejs
initially ryan named as web.js to create webserver but later he named to nodejs considering this has more potential
nodejs is non blocking IO and advantage with non blocking IO is it can handle multiple requests with less threads
in 2020 npm happened it is package manager for node which developed by joyent employee to manage packages
nodejs will not be successful without npm
in 2009 the nodejs support was there only for macos and linux and in 2011 nodejs got windows support by joyent and microsoft
in 2012 left the project and the nodejs repsonsibility was given to isaac who developed npm
in 2014 developer fedor created a fork of nodejs and named io.js
in 2015 fedor and joynet got merged and nodejs foundation came and told that they will maintain nodejs
in 2019 js foundation and nodejs foundation merged and formed open js foundation took the control of nodejs
