creating a server
how web works
how user makes a request to our server and response is sent
server
client

server 
sometimes server word is used for hardware, software...
deploy your app to server: we are deploying an application on the server, 
like deploying an application on the server or running the application on the operation system, and application serves to the clients who wants to connect to our server
server will have lot of files/data/memory etc...
to access those files and other things from out side world, we need a way to connect right
so we need an application running in the OS so that we can handle requests coming from the users and send back the data accordingly
server is like sytem or machine or hardware --->contain files/images/data ---> need an application running/deployed to the hardware in the OS to handle request and to send data back to the user
sometimes we refer the app deployed to the hardware as the server
sometimes we refer the hardware machine as the server
servers on aws: means aws managing the hardwares, aws is giving the hardware resource to deploy our application on that server(in this context, server is hardware)
when we have a server in aws, ec2 instance-> a cpu or computer managed by aws to deploy our application
so here aws is managing the hardware and software
we can computer as server as well,,.. but my limited has limited ram and storage, so many efforts, but in aws servers we can scale and they are up and running with huge power backups..
so server is like computer or hardware where our app is hosted...and through the app we can handle the incoming requests
when we take a server or machine in aws, we have an dedicted IP


software part 
using node to create a web server
what does this mean
we are creating an http server using node
what does this mean
means im creating an application server to handle the user requests


client server architecture
client is one accessing the server
ever client has an IP address
and ever server has an IP address
server has files/photos/docs
if user from the browser wants to access the file on the server,,, this client has to open socket connection  or send an requests..
somebody should listen to the incoming requests right, 
that application is listening to the request and giving the data, here this application is also known as server 
once the client makes an request, a socket connection is opened and here our application/server fetches the data and gives back and the socket connection will be closed
when the socket connection is made, when the data is sent back, TCP/IP protocal is used to sent the data

what is protocol
set of rules defined between two computers to talk

on the server, we might heard http server or FTP server, smtp server...
when client makes an request, socket connection opens and there are different rules/protocols which the server will send the response back 
these rules are know as http, ftp, smtp
like the data can be sent back in http, ftp or smtp rules
if we have a server just serves only files, then we use FTP rule to send those files
SMTP: simple mail transfer protocal

when we create a server using node, here server is web server(here server is an application kind to receive and send back the data), means we are creating the http server 

when we send a request from teh client, data will come in small packets/streams/buffers...this is data controlled by TCP/IP protocol

every domain name is mapped to an IP

DNS server manages the mapping for IP address and domain name
can i create multiple http servers --yes  which means 2 different node applications to seve the incoming request
how do we know we have to go which http server, decides by port
one http server uses the port 1010 and another might use port 3000
IP + port tells which http server we are referring
http server you can assume as one node application to handle the incoming requests and for giving the data back

IP + PORT ---tells which application to go --
if we give path as well, --- it tells which application to go to and it is associate to an api

namastedev.com is domain name maps to an IP 
http server can be created in multiple langues, here are we are using nodejs

lets say namastedev.com/ -> maps to react application in same server which gives the html 
namastedev.com/api/getusers --> maps to nodejs application in the same server where we can map namastedev.com/api maps to different port where nodejs application presents

in the same server, we can do our front end application, back end , db , file managin we can do that
but in lot of cases, in big cases or big companies, they keep DB into one server , different sever for file, different server for images, 
so a server can interact with other server like front end application kept in one server and if we need some files or somethign, this server interacts with another server and gets the data back,
this is also possible
all applications like front end and back end can be maintained in teh same server or for big companies they can maintain in different servers

eg: namastedev is serveed by aws server for fornt end and back end but db is on another server

socket vs websocket
socket is like when client request somethign the socket connection is opened and closed and if again , again the socket is opened and closed,
but with websocket, this connection is not closed and holds for a long time
for a server, there is a limit of sockets
so web socket has some limits

nodejs has http module to create a server to listen to incoming requests

http is not that feasible, so we use express

express.js is nodejs is application framework
express is built on nodejs
