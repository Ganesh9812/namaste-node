mongodb
how to create mongodb
how to write code to connect to db
how to connect mongodb with nodejs
community version is free version for the devs to use
enterprise version is for companies....

both can be self managed- 
both can be managed by mongodb

for this course we use the mongodb free version where managed by the mongodb for free
after downloading and installing it and since we are asking mongodb team to manage it, mongodb will take the db and deploy the cluster in some machine or server

ganeshpavankumars
cOeeng04sYTtEKA9

after settings done, we need to get the connection string to use the mongodb now

select compass 
copy the connection string

mongodb+srv://ganeshpavankumars:<db_password>@namastenode.yqrkb.mongodb.net/

mongodb compass is the UI to see the database we opted and asked mongodb team to put in aws

install mongodb compass
connect database to compass

put this "mongodb+srv://ganeshpavankumars:cOeeng04sYTtEKA9@namastenode.yqrkb.mongodb.net/cOeeng04sYTtEKA" in the compass when creating a new connection

now we can access the cluster using compass and we can create multiple separate databases

cluster link
https://cloud.mongodb.com/v2/66cb069d2e518d2b1a746bec#/clusters

once we link mongodb cluster to the mongodb compass, then you can create the db using compass
db name
collection name is table name 
now we can add data means you can add documents into it
document is nothing but json object
when we dont give id, document will give id after adding the data

now using the nodejs code we can push the data to the existing document
first lets connect nodejs to mongodb
database is in cloud server managed by aws and compass is just GUI
we will connect through the below url
 "mongodb+srv://ganeshpavankumars:cOeeng04sYTtEKA9@namastenode.yqrkb.mongodb.net/";
 for this we need npm package known as mongodb
 npm is a repository where it contain lot of node modules
 fs is managed by node thats why we didnt install it explicity
 but mongodb is managed by mongodb we need to install that package
 npm install mongodb


assume one row in sql as one document in mongodb

in prod we wont use mongodb library package for getting or updating the database..
we use mongoose library 

in our project we use express js and mongoose to connect to database
like how to create a server using express.js like how we created using http in the server.js file
and how we can use moongoose to create the db connection and also inserting doc and reading the data using mongoose
